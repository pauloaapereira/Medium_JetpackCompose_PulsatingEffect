## Description
Since the Android team released Jetpack Compose first beta version, Iâ€™ve been trying my best to keep in sync with all the updates, by following the Android Dev Challenges and also by trying to reproduce my projects with it.
So, I have decided to publish an article on Medium about how to implement a Pulsating Effect with Jetpack Compose.
